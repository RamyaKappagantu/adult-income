# 📊 Income Classification with Supervised Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning models to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K per year using the U.S. Adult Income dataset. It includes a full pipeline from data cleaning to model evaluation, showcasing practical skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model comparison.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Predict high-income individuals using demographic and occupational data.
- Build and evaluate multiple classification models.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features effectively.
- Compare model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**: Data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: ML models and evaluation
- **XGBoost**: Advanced ensemble method

---

## 📈 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model is trained, tuned, and evaluated using consistent metrics, and performance is compared at the end.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Group-wise imputation for missing values
- Outlier detection and masking via boxplots
- Label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Model benchmarking using classification metrics
- Clear and modular code structure

## 🌍 Use Cases & Applicability

This project can be adapted for classification problems in domains like:

- **Customer Profiling**: Predicting customer value or churn
- **Marketing Analytics**: Target segmentation or conversion prediction
- **HR Analytics**: Employee attrition or promotion likelihood

It serves as a reusable pipeline for structured datasets with a binary target variable.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV)
- Incorporate cross-validation
- Deploy the best model using `joblib` or Flask
- Use SHAP or LIME for model interpretability

### 🔁 How to Reuse This Project
This notebook is designed to be adapted to other classification problems with structured data. To reuse:

1. Replace the `adult_income.csv` with your dataset.
2. Update column names and types as needed.
3. Follow the preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and encoding.
4. Train and evaluate models using the modular classifier framework provided.

Perfect for datasets with:
- Mixed categorical and numerical features.
- Binary classification targets (e.g., churn, loan default, conversion)
